    <h1><u>REPORT</u></h1>

    <ol>
        <li>URL to git repository: <a href="https://github.com/343S25/343-kirkpams-projects-logan-page.git">REPO</a></li>
        <li>URL to the project: <a href="https://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/pagelr/cs343/project/src/index.html">Listening Gallery</a></li>
        <li>Media queries are the last css function on both style sheets - for screens smaller than 500 pixels wide</li>
        <li>There are 2 pages: The Info page and the Listening Gallery Page</li>
        <li>My page contains a header at the top of the Listening Gallery page: has links, a title, and a form</li>
        <li>The header has links to the info page and Spotify, as well as at the bottom of the Info page
            for verification and to go back to the gallery page
        </li>
        <li>Each image has alt text the tells the title of the song and the artist(s) of the song</li>
        <li>Both html and css files returned no errors or warnings on <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/">NU HTML Checker</a></li>
        <li>Headers use 'lucida sans' font and the rest of the text is 'lucida console' font</li>
        <li>The form is in the header and has search inputs for song title and song artist; has buttons for submitting the search and
            clearing the page. Also has a form that is a drop-down menu in the Customization link in the same header that can edit the
            colors of the page
        </li>
        <li>The external link in the header goes to the Spotify home page</li>
        <li>The verify and token links in the main page allow access to the spotify API. The search form fetches a song and saves its
            data to local storage based on the data provided: the more specific the better
        </li>
