            <h1>Welcome to the Listening Gallery</h1>
            <p>
                The Listening Gallery aims to help people keep track of their favorite songs
                in a separated environment in the form of their own personal art gallery.
                A lot of current playlist applications donâ€™t display the interesting
                album covers, or at least not big enough to really see sometimes. Instead of having
                a bland list of songs, it can look more like an art museum displaying the creativity
                of publishing music beyond the beats and lyrics. It is not a super important issue to
                solve, but some people who have a deeper appreciation of presentation may have a desire
                to have their songs displayed with a cover that helps visually display their song. The
                purpose is to have fun with it, and make a musical portfolio that can be edited between
                music and color. This gives someone the power to express themselves through their music
                tastes, as being able to convey our interest in this form of art can be helpful in interacting
                with others and make us feel involved. This is supposed to be a space where the effort put into
                the cover can be appreciated to its fullest extent; an image that can be heard.
